<h1>Rota</h1>

<p>The proposed schedule is along the lines of</p>
<ul>
    <li>After riders change shift, all 8 off duty riders will stop together and eat / socialise for 20 to 30 minutes
    </li>
    <li>The riders coming off shoft are off duty.
        The off duty sleeper-driver will drive the sleeper up the road to the next meeting point.
        Other off duty riders are free to head up the road with the sleeper-driver to
        sleep in sleeper, ride with support van or socialise in CamperHQ.
        The sleeper will head straight to the next meeting point.
    </li>
    <li>The van driver and assistant ( who is also sleeper-driver ) will chase down the riders and support them for the
        rest of the shift. The
        assistant may drive the Van if required
    </li>
    <li>The logistics and CamperHQ-Driver will clear up after mealtime and head up the road to the next meeting point
    </li>
    <li>... some time will pass with CamperHQ and Sleeper parked up at rendevous point</li>
    <li>The logistics and CamperHQ-Driver will prepare food for the riders coming off shift</li>
    <li>The Van driver and assistant will leave the riders approximately 15 minutes from the meeting point to get ready
        to
        ride.
    </li>
    <li>The riders will arrive at the meeting point</li>
    <li>The new riders will head straight off, the last riders will eat / socialise for 20 to 30 minutes</li>
    <li>...repeat to Lands End</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Break Down At Any Point</h2>
<h3>1 - There 4 riders on the road</h3>

<h3>2 - There are 4 riders just come off shift who are now off-duty.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They will eat briefly</li>
    <li>1 will drive the sleeper which will take approx 1/3 of the shift time, assuming camper will travel 3 times
        quicker than riders.
    </li>
    <li>3 will be completely off duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>3 - There are 4 riders about to come on shift who are now on support duty</h3>
<ul>
    <li>CamperHQ driver and logistics in HQ</li>
    <li>Van driver and assistant in support Van ( note that Van assistant is also Sleeper driver )</li>
</ul>


<h2>Time break down per role per 24 hour period</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time on the bike. This equates to approximately 8 hours per day</p>
