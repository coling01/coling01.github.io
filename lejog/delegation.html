<h2 id="route">Route Planning Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To ensure we have a route of 1000 miles from JOG to LE</li>
    <li>To try and pass through Preston, Alderley, anywhere else ?</li>
    <li>To minimise the climbing where possible</li>
    <li>Identify potential stopping / rendevous points or other useful locations such as bike shops, places we can get a
        brew, general shops and the nearest A&E.
    </li>
    <li>Identify some options for refill / empty water tanks ( relatively easy, suggest that we can simply empty grey
        tank in road drains ! )
    </li>
    <li>Identify some options for empty chemical toilet. May need campsite for this.</li>
    <li>Provide strava routes in suitable block sizes, maybe 100 miles or so</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="check">Route Checking Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To carefully go through Matts route and confirm its as good as can be</li>
    <li>Compare with sustrans routes map <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map?lat=56.54737192673878&lng=-3.142090281250036&zoom=5&route-type=all-routes&filters=">Map<a> and ensure the strava route lines up when it should</li>
    <li>Check that any a-roads are not dual carriageways</li>
    <li>Try to confirm that minor roads are surfaced and not off road dirt tracks</li>
    <li>Confirm that avoiding any major towns or cities that would lead to delays at traffic lights or junctions.</li>
    <li>Check that got optimum height avoidance where possible</li>
    <li>Check that distance is good at 1000+ miles</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nav">Nav Goals</h2>
<p>
    We have a group of riders who should normally be together ( excepting climbs ) and support van, camperHQ an sleeper.
    We require
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Riders to be able to follow a route on garmin or phone ( say Strava ) using a suitable device mount on
        handlebars
    </li>
    <li>At least one rider in group, preferably all, to beacon their position so they be tracked by Van and CamperHQ
    </li>
    <li>Each vehicle to beacon their position to allow visibility by the other vehicles.</li>
    <li>Each vehicle to have navigation visibility of each other and riders. Presumably on a mac or laptop</li>
    <li>We require 3 mobile phones to allow vehicles to always reliably contact each, also for riders to know what
        number to ring for support
    </li>
    <li>Mission is to find the best app to use for phones to beacon and laptops or macs in vehicles.</li>
    <li>And liase with rest of team to source necessary hardware / ensure everybody has necessary kit.</li>
    <li>And sims for phones and laptops for internet access</li>
    <li>But not worry about the route itself, Matt is handling that. Maybe liase with Matt to ensure the route is
        available on selected apps
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="power">Power Goals</h2>
<p>
    We need to ensure that everybodys tech kit can be powered / charged
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Phones / Garmins. Likely USB.
    </li>
    <li>Bike lights. Find out what lights, many rear lights may be USB. Headlights may require mains ?
    </li>
    <li>Source a generator if required. Seems likely to be useful for this and catering such as Kettle and Microwave.
        Maybe Tumble Dryer ?). We can see the camper vans 21st Jan and have questions about whether we can use a
        generator which would help greatly
    </li>
    <li>Provide enough charging points for sufficient devices in CamperHQ and suitable box or storage to keep them safe
        whilst travelling
    </li>
    <li>Ensure Navigation / Comms laptop / tablet / phone can be charged in Van and Sleeper</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="catering">Catering Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create simple menus that can be easily prepared in camperHQ. Menus and prep instructions to be laminated to
        allow others to do the prep
    </li>
    <li>Ensure sufficient cooking capacity in camperHQ. Bring in additional burners if required. Will we have sufficient
        gas ? Can we share gas between campers ?
    </li>
    <li>Any pre-prep of food required to make prep easier?</li>
    <li>Maybe a generator would be useful to allow microwave and kettle for quickly boiling cooking water and power
        microwave. Source this from somewhere
    </li>
    <li>Nearer the time prepare a shopping list to initially stock the camperHQ. We can restock fresh food on Saturday
        with a tactical hit on a supermarket.
    </li>
    <li>Provide simple snacks for sleeper</li>
    <li>Nutrition for riders ... riders preferred drinks and snacks to be passed to van when new riders come on.
        Maintain a list of rider preferences for shopping purposes
    </li>
    <li>Suggest options for those wanting to buy in hot food i.e. Chinese, Chippy, Pizza etc. Maintain list of
        preferences
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toolkit">Toolkit Goals</h2>
<p>We will have plenty of bikes to use as spares in the event of bike failure. But everybody prefers their own bike so
    be good to be able to fix common issues</p>
<p>Collate list of Riders bike sizes and any special setups to assist sharing if required. Also groupset type and number
    of cassette rings to assist wheel swaps if required</p>
<p>Each rider will bring sufficient spare tubes, tyre levers and onbike pump</p>
<p>Central toolkit and spares will include</p>
