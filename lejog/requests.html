            and rural / dark then I would jump in a bunk bed whilst travelling as passenger!

        <td>I would like to be able to start and finish the ride. Is so the first hour and last 2 hours of feasible.
        </td>
        <td>Agree. Maybe we park the vehicles a few miles down the road and all cycle to JOG then double back
            together with none riders jumping off when pass the Campers.
            Else 3 volunteers to drive the vehicles, CG and MM volunteered. Might be a concern leaving all 3 vehicles
            parked up what if get robbed could wreck the trip.
            CG. TBC.
