<h1>Rota</h1>

<p>The proposed schedule is along the lines of</p>
<ul>
  <li>After riders change shift, all 8 off duty riders will stop together and eat / socialise for 20 to 30 minutes
  </li>
  <li>The riders coming off shift are now "off duty".
    The off duty sleeper-driver will drive the sleeper up the road to the next meeting point.
    Other off duty riders are free to head up the road with the sleeper-driver to
    sleep in sleeper, socialise in CamperHQ, or ride with next group.
    The sleeper will head straight to the next meeting point thus anybody not in the sleeper will not see it again till
    just before the next changeover.
  </li>
  <li>The support team will clear up after mealtime and head up the road to the catch the riders
  </li>
  <li>... some time will pass with Sleeper parked up at rendevous point</li>
  <li>The CamperHQ will keep within 15 minutes of the riders in case support needed.</li>
  <li>The CamperHQ will leave the riders approximately 15 minutes from the meeting point to get ready
    to ride.
  </li>
  <li>The support team will prepare food for the riders coming off shift <b>Now this is more tricky with doubling up as
    rider support. TBD but seems likely will need to leave the riders 30 minutes before meet point</b></li>
  <li>The riders will arrive at the meeting point</li>
  <li>The new riders will head straight off, the last riders will eat / socialise for 20 to 30 minutes</li>
  <li>...repeat to Lands End</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Break Down At Any Point</h2>
<h3>1 - There 4 riders on the road</h3>

<h3>2 - There are 4 riders just come off shift who are now off-duty.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They will eat briefly</li>
  <li>1 will drive the sleeper which will take approx 1/3 of the shift time, assuming camper will travel 3 times
    quicker than riders.
  </li>
  <li>3 will be completely off duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>3 - There are 4 riders about to come on shift who are now on support duty</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CamperHQ driver will need to keep moving the Van in front of the riders. Suggest leap frog with 5 minutes behind
    and then 10 minute in front of riders. Which would mean something like drive for 10 minutes, park for 10 minutes and
    repeat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Captain will plan and prep for the changeover using whatever support is available in the CamperHQ. Tasks include
    Navigation, Food prep, Bike prep, Setup and Clearup for eating etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support is whoever else is in the CamperHQ and will assist CamperHQ driver, support riders when passing, support
    Captain with anything thats needs doing.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Time break down per role per 24 hour period</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time on the bike. This equates to approximately 8 hours per day</p>

<h2>Off Duty Time</h2>
<p>Whilst off duty, each rider can decide how to spend their time</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any problems or issues will initially be dealt with by the supporting team in CamperHQ but of course anybody maybe
    needed to step in
  </li>
  <li>They may choose to head up the road in the sleeper campervan</li>
  <li>They may choose to socialise / help with CamperHQ functions</li>
  <li>They may choose to ride with the current group</li>
</ul>
