<h1>Support Roles</h1>

<p>We need to allocate support roles as we can only have 3 drivers on each camper to ensure that we always have a HQ Driver and
  a Sleeper Driver in each group</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Support Role</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HQ Driver</td>
    <td>Off duty in sleeper</td>
    <td>Driving HQ and supporting riders</td>
    <td>Since the HQ will also provide support for riders this is a busy role</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sleeper Driver</td>
    <td>Drive Sleeper then off duty in sleeper</td>
    <td>Relax in HQ</td>
    <td>Driving Sleeper when off duty, approximately 1/3 of off duty shift.

  <tr>
    <td>Captain</td>
    <td>Off duty in sleeper</td>
    <td>Organise the team in the camperHQ to ensure slick operation</td>
    <td>Delegating to any other available which may include the Captain role once settled into routine. Tasks are listed
      below
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Support</td>
    <td>Off duty in sleeper</td>
    <td>Supporting HQ driver or logistics if needed</td>
    <td>Helping out with anything needed</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Tasks to be done / delegated by Captain</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Navigation. Ensure route to the next changeover is clear to Riders, Sleeper, HQ Driver, HQ Driver Support</li>
  <li>Organising timely food for riders coming off shift</li>
  <li>Ensuring riders coming on shift are ready for changeover</li>
  <li>Ensuring bikes are unloaded and ready for riders coming on shift</li>
  <li>Ensuring bikes coming off shift are loaded onto free rack</li>
  <li>Ensuring all lights are put on charge after coming off shift</li>
  <li>Anything else for smooth running</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The detailed proposed schedule for each role is detailed in rota page here ...

<h2>Groupings / Roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We need to have rough groupings to ensure that we allocate roles approximately evenly, it would be no good
    having all CamperHQ drivers in one group for example
  </li>
  <li>After a couple of shifts when everybody is getting settled we can move riders up or down as requested by those
    wanting to move up a group for a few rotations
  </li>
  <li>We are top and middle heavy ( no pun intended for those who are more gravitationally challenged ), more riders
    fit the A B group speeds. But <b>everybody</b> is happy to mix it up with
    other groups which makes a more sociable trip. And its easier to move riders down than move riders up.
  </li>
  <li>Some riders are stronger on the flat and less strong on the hills so we may mix up the groups according to the
    up coming terrain
  </li>
  <li>If we have less than 4 riders in any group we will take turns to fill the group from other groups.
  </li>
</ul>
