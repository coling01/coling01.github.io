</div>

<h2>Role of Logistics Support on board camper</h2>
In order of priority if we dont have much support ( which is highly likely and would mean more tasks falling to riders in camper ! )
<ul>
    <li>Delegate all activities below to a next-rider coming on shift if required</li>
    <li>Liase with next-riders coming on shift to agree distance to be covered ( related to shift length of course which
        is
        agreed with all riders the forthcoming shift lengths)
    </li>
    <li>Agree changeover point with riders getting on bikes and communicate this with support coming on shift and sleeper driver.</li>
    <li>Track sleeper and lead CamperHQ to sleeper and van leading rider meetup for rider changeover</li>
    <li>Delegate any roles to rider from each team when necessary</li>
    <li>Help cook and serve food to riders coming off shift</li>
    <li>Ensure all vehicles know when to refuel and instruct drivers accordingly</li>
    <li>Be familiar with route for navigation assistance if required by sleeper or van</li>
    <li>Assist riders coming off to get lights on charge</li>
    <li>Setup food area outside van if weather OK else eating area inside van if not</li>
    <li>Clear up after eating</li>
    <li>Help offload new riders bikes at meeting point before incoming riders arrive</li>
    <li>Help load up old riders bikes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role of the riders on board camper</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Help support / pickup any roles not covered by support or delegated by support</li>
    <li>Drive the camper ( likely required ) 1/3 of the time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes for Camper</h2>
<p>Thurs Fri Sat Sun Mon 5 nights</p>
<p>Possible issue that only 3 drivers per vehicle. Means each team has only 1 driver per camper. Cannot drive other
    camper. Might be a pain. One driver stuck with CamperHQ and one driver stuck with Sleeper. And restricts movements between
    teams
    At least there will normally be 2 teams not riding so 2 drivers available for each camper. May help to select
    drivers who are least likely to switch groups</p>
