<h1>Transition between Riders</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    The transition point is agreed before riders setoff and is pretty much fixed since the resting team will head
    straight there.
  </li>
  <li>In the event of the riders getting tired / struggling then the support team can take over early, the riders
    finishing early can take over support until the transition point. So if the C team get tired, the A team will be
    supporting and can switch shift early
  </li>
</ul>
<div>Prior to transition point the outgoing support crew will ensure the following</div>
<ul>
  <li>Decide transition point and prepare to communicate with other teams</li>
  <li>Prepare to ride including offloading from HQ and prepping their own bikes</li>
  <li>Switch resters bikes from sleeper to HQ</li>
  <li>Get to transition point early to ensure food is prepared</li>
  <li>Prepare food for incoming riders plus resting riders</li>
  <li>Setup eating area outside if good weather</li>
  <li>Wake the incoming support team who are currently resting</li>
  <li>Ensure the incoming support captain is ready to serve food to the riders coming off shift taking into account
    rider preferences.
  </li>
  <li>The incoming support captain will decide whether to wake his team to eat or let them rest a little longer</li>
  <li>Anything else to ensure smooth transition</li>
</ul>
<div>After the transition point the incoming support crew will ensure the following</div>
<ul>
  <li>Load incoming riders bikes on sleeper</li>
  <li>Serve food to outgoing riders ( who are incoming resters ) as quickly as possible to allow them to eat and then hit the road to maximise rest</li>
  <li>Eat and socialise with the outgoing riders</li>
  <li>Support the outgoing riders with anything they need to get on the road as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>Clear up, pack up prepare to roll</li>
