<h1>Hygiene</h1>

<h2>Toilet</h2>
<p>The campers will provide emergency toilet if desperate but may struggle to cope with 12 people</p>
<p>We may need to stop occasionally near toilet facilities which will need planing. Maybe stopping at a pub or services
    when near motorway services. This could allow use of shower facilities as well.
</p>

<h2>Washing</h2>
<p>Both campers will provide hot water for a basic wash and will have a shower if anybody
    desperate.</p>

<h2>Campsites</h2>
<p>The campers have membership of caravan club so maybe we can use this in some way. We can check the route and identify
    possible places to stop off for showers and maybe parkup for a few hours. And refresh water supplies / empty
    tanks. The grey water can just be run off into public drains. The toilet cassettes will need emptying at a campsite</p>

<h2>Planned Stops</h2>
<p>Matty is planning the route in details with designated stopping points. This will include points of interest such as
    campsites so we may be able to plan using campsites along the route for showers / toilets etc. Maybe we iwll contact
    some of the campsites to see if possible to use the facilities, since we are raising money for charity.</p>
