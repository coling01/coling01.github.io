<h1>Wind History</h1>

<p>Was hoping that we could defer the decision South/North or North/South till a couple of days before. But some riders
    may need to get trains and thus need booking early</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to get an idea of what typical winds are.</p>
<p>The following site gives past weather going back to 2010 so I will maybe do some samples over last few Aprils.
