<h1>Rota</h1>

<p>The proposed schedule is along the lines of</p>
<ul>
    <li>After riders change shift, all 8 off duty riders will stop together and eat / socialise for 20 to 30 minutes
    </li>
    <li>The off duty riders ( those who will be next on shift ) are free to head up the road with the sleeper-driver to
        sleep in sleeper, ride with support van or socialise in camper-HQ
    </li>
    <li>The van driver will chase down the riders and support them for the rest of the shift. Usually with support from
        one off duty volunteer who could also drive the van if required.
    </li>
    <li>The logistics and HQ-Driver will clear up after mealtime and head up the road</li>
    <li>The sleeper drive is free to go with Sleeper, Van or HQ</li>
    <li>... some time will pass with Camper-HQ and Sleeper parked up at rendevous point</li>
    <li>The logistics and HQ-Driver will prepare food for the riders coming off shift</li>
    <li>The Van driver ( and support ) will lead the riders to the rendezvous</li>
    <li>Van driver, HQ-Driver and Logistics are now off shift. The sleeper driver comes on shift to drive the sleeper as
        required by the team
    </li>
    <li>
        It is expected that one off duty person will support the Van driver and maybe even drive the van if designated
        driver
        is tired
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Break Down At Any Point</h2>
<h3>1 - There 4 riders on the road</h3>

<h3>2 - There are 4 riders just come off shift - 3 of 4 are performing a duty after eating</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 driving the support van</li>
    <li>1 driving the camper-HQ</li>
    <li>1 running logistics / catering in the camperhq</li>
    <li>1 designated for sleeper driver off duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>3 - There are 4 riders about to come on shift - 3 of 4 are off duty after eating</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Van driver, HQ-driver and Logistics off duty</li>
    <li>Sleeper-driver on duty to drive up the road as required by the team</li>
    <li>1 off duty person required to support the Van driver</li>
</ul>


<h2>Time break down per role per 24 hour period</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time on the bike. This equates to approximately 8 hours per day</p>
