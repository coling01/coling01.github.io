<h1>Support</h1>

<div>
    Ideally we would have at least 1 support person who can manage the logistics for the initial shift whilst riders are getting organised.
    The danger of only having 1 person is they may get overloaded with expectation of managing the team as well as cooking etc.
    Will try to work out if we can manage without support, then if we have any it will be a bonus.
    Maybe we could ask the support to work during the day and let them take the car up the road to sleep. Maybe even stay in a hotel.
    Possibly even 2 campers to allow proper bed sleeps.
