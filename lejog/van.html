<h1>Van</h1>

<div>The van will provide close support to the riders to allow the other vehicles to head up the road.
    It may be a van or maybe a car with trailer or good roofrack for ease of transporting any bikes or riders needin support, to catch bck up with the team if required.
    The van will be manned by 2 riders who have just come off shift.
    The van will have a dedicated mobile phone so that all riders know who to ring with any problems.
    Expect that the van will do something along the lines of
    <ul>
        <li>After changing shift the riders coming off will eat parked up with the camper for 20-30 mins. This will mean the riders have got up the road by 6-8 miles</li>
        <li>The van will then chase the riders, slow and check they are ok as it passes for a few minutes</li>
        <li>Dish out any drinks, snacks, swap clothing that may be required</li>
        <li>Push on up the road for another few miles then park and wait for the riders to pass</li>
        <li>Again, support the riders with any requirements as the riders pass the van</li>
        <li>Allow the riders to get a few miles up the road, then drive to pass them and leap frog them again</li>
        <li>Any issues with the riders they will call the van and request attendance</li>
        <li>The van will carry tools and spares as deemed necessary</li>
        <li>Riders will carry their own spare tubes but may called the van for additional assistance, especially if puncture in the dark</li>
        <li>The van will be in contact with the camper and know where the changeover point is. As the riders get close, the van will liase with the riders and lead them to the meetup with the camper where riders will change over</li>
    </ul>
