<h1>Hygiene</h1>

<h2>Toilet</h2>
<p>The campers will provide emergency toilet if desperate but would struggle to cope with 12 people</p>
<p>We will need to stop occasionally near toilet facilities which will need planing. Maybe stopping at a pub or services
    when near motorway services. This could allow use of shower facilities as well.
</p>

<h2>Washing</h2>
<p>Both campers will provide hot water for a basic wash and will have a shower for emergency use if anybody desperate.</p>

<h2>Campsites</h2>
<p>The campers have membership of caravan club so maybe we can use this in some way. We can check the route and identify
    possible places to stop off for showers and maybe parkup for a few hours. And refresh water supplies / empty tanks.</p>
