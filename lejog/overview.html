</ul>


<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 riders which is the maximum we can transport in 2 Campers.
    </li>
    <li>3 groups of riders with 3 to 5 riders per group.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rotations will be a) Ride b) Rest c) Support ... repeat.
    </li>
    <li>Begin Jog 01:00 Friday morning. Arrive Le 09:00 Monday morning which gives us 80 hours to cover the
        distance.
    </li>
    <li>1000 miles over 80 hours means an average speed of 12mph. But possible we may go quicker and have some complete
        breaks.
        ( See speed section for breakdowns )
    </li>
    <li>
        The shift duration needs discussion and agreement but expected to be between 1 hour and 4 hours. Maybe we have shorter shifts during the day to allow more socialising and longer shifts during the night to allow more sleep.
    </li>
    <li>Still a little worried about the wind so hedging in case we need to switch direction. Tracking flight prices here.
