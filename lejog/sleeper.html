<h1>Sleeper</h1>

<h2>Role of the Sleeper</h2>
<p>The sleeper is a 6 berth camper van with the primary function of providing sleep.</p>
<p>It is a Lugano camper ( same as HQ Camper ) hired from Freedhome. The spec for the Lugano is here <a href="index.html?camperspec.html">Lugano</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The sleeper will have a dedicated mobile phone so that the camper or van can contact if required.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sleeper be used to head up the road as quickly as possible to provide opportunities to sleep.
    </li>
    <li>Carry 4 bikes on rack as required</li>
    <li>It will have some food supplies but most catering will be done in the HQ</li>
    <li>... 2 full size dedicated bunk beds at the rear</li>
    <li>... A drop down double bed that takes about 20 seconds to deploy</li>
    <li>... A single bed on the drivers side of the dining area which requires no setup</li>
    <li>... A 3/4 double bed on the passenger side of the dining area which is very complicated probably takes 5 minutes to setup.</li>
    <li>It would make sense to leave the dining area set up for sleeping, but this may or may not leave enough seats for travelling</li>
</ul>
