<h1>Rider Questions</h1>

<p>Whilst compiling the information across these pages I have come to a better understanding of how the trip will work
    out.
</p>


<p>Of course there are lots of decisions to be made, some need making more urgently and these are listed below</p>
<h2>Next Urgent</h2>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Question</th>
        <th>Supporting Information</th>
        <th>Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="green">Do we have a car as well as Camper and Van ?</td>
        <td>It may be a burden to have an extra vehicle, especially if no support staff. We could manage with a van and
            an 8 berth camper, with generally 6 on board the camper.
        </td>
        <td>Just 2 Campers for maximum flexibility with riders not tied to vehicles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="green">Do we take our 9 hours break across multiple nights or maybe hotel Saturday night ?</td>
        <td>Some may prefer a real bed and shower etc.</td>
        <td>No hotel since reduces our flexibility. 2 campers instead. And general feeling is that we wont be that fast so likely not so much of a break</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="green">Do we need support staff ?</td>
        <td>Ideally but dont have anybody coming forward yet and maybe we can manage without. Matt is trying to get
            support from Bristol
        </td>
        <td>Covered support with rota.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td  class="green">Can we keep the direction open ?</td>
        <td>Ideally but Bri needs to book travel. If we want to book Hotel Sat night then maybe. We may need to decide
            soon. Bri has booked train to Preston Thursday afternoon and return from Penzance Monday.
        </td>
        <td>Decided to go from JOG to LE.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td  class="green">How will we get bikes to and from start / end?</td>
        <td>We have 2 campers with 4 bike racks on each.</td>
        <td>Will need to put 4 bikes in campers "garage" for traveeling up to JOG and back from LE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="green">Will we ride, support then rest or ride, rest and then support?</td>
        <td>We want slick changeovers and best option for resting</td>
        <td>Consensus is that better to ride, (eat), rest then support before riding again.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td class="green">How long shall we ride for ?</td>
        <td>Expect multiple of 30 minutes between maybe 1 hour at start of ride increasing to 3 or 4 hours during the
            night. Although we can play this by ear a little, it is helpful to have an idea for planning.
        </td>
        <td>Still tbd</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="amber">What route to take ?</td>
        <td>I did put down an approximate route in these pages, it is only 960 miles currently. Matt is planning a
            detailed route with potential stops every 10 miles and useful information like bike shops, hospitals etc.
            Matts 1000 mile route will use sustrans routes where possible, go through Garstang ( charity ), Preston and close to Alderley edge.
