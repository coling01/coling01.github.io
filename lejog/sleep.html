<h1>Sleep</h1>

A few people have remarked that lack of sleep is their biggest concern.

There are several ways in which we can ensure that we can all get enough sleep, depending on personal preference.
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        As can be seen in Speed page, if we average 14mph moving time across the 3 groups and aim to leave at 01:00
        Friday and arrive 09:00 Monday, then we can take <b>9 hours in breaks</b>
    </li>
    <li>If all agree then suggest we take 2 breaks Saturday night and Sunday night with target of 4 and 5 hours each
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Shift length</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The assumptions below are for a 3 hour shift pattern. We could increase this to say 4 hours which gives those
        in car and camper a longer time to get some sleep as required.
    </li>
    <li>
        To understand how this works out is complex and I will create a spreadsheet to better illustrate.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Car - See Car page</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders coming off shift can drive up the road in the car for a double shift. With a shift time of 3 hours,
        this will be a 6
        hour break during which they can eat at the camper then drive.
    </li>
    <li>Since the riders will be on the road for 6 hours at 14mph, the car travelling at 50mph will need to drive for
        less than 2 hours. During which the paasenger can sleep
    </li>
    <li>When car parks up the driver can throw up a tent or maybe have a van can sleep in the back</li>
    <li>This should give the driver at least 3 hours sleep</li>
    <li>If the van driver is happy to support cyclists on own then 3 riders could travel up the road in car</li>
    <li>2 riders out of 12 would be in car so each rider could be 2 shifts in car then 10 shifts before in car again.
        Over 80 hours this would be 26*3 hours sessions.
        So riders may get 2*6 hour shifts in car or maybe 1*6 hour and a couple of shorter shifts in car.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Van - See Van page</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders coming off shift will drive the van for single shift and provide support whilst leap frogging the
        riders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Passenger may be able to grab some shuteye if driver is OK
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Camper - See Camper page ... this ones complex!</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 riders in camper may get some sleep ( though supposed to be in seats whilst driving )
    </li>
</ul>
