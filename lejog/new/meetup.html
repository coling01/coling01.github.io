<h2>Assuming a North South routing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Seens and Stuart plus Colin and Matt to pickup Campers between 14:00 and 16:00 which requires a
    handover which
    takes approximately 1 hour. Then drive from Radcliffe to Preston
  </li>
  <li>Others to meet up at Colin/Mikes house m6 junction32 17:00. 2/7 Somerset Park, PR27HA</li>
  <li>Merv, Vin, Tony coming from Alderley Edge</li>

  <li>Tim coming from Clitheroe</li>
  <li>Load B team bikes on HQ rack</li>
  <li>Load C team bikes on Sleeper rack</li>
  <li>Load A team bikes inside Sleeper</li>
</ul>

<div>It is intended to have bikes on the vehicle they are travelling in, thus support team will have their own
  bkes on the HQ bike rack, resters will have their bikes on Sleeper bike rack. Thus when transition, resters bikes will be moved from Sleeper to HQ and incoming riders bikes
  loaded onto Sleeper.
</div>
<div>Other considerations</div>
