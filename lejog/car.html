<h1>Car</h1>

<h2>Role of the Car</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The car will have a dedicated mobile phone so that the camper or van can contact if required.
    </li>
    <li>
        The car be used to head up the road as quickly as possible to provide opportunities to sleep.
    </li>
    <li>
        It will jump ahead for 2 shifts to maximise the rest time with a driver and passenger who have just ome
        off-shift.
    </li>
    <li>
        Expect that the car will have popup tent(s) and airbeds, unless an estate or van can be found with a bed in the
        bed.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    Maybe we should hire a small van ?
    If we do have support, the support could use the car to get up the road for a good break and maybe even stay in a
    hotel to make it less arduous.
