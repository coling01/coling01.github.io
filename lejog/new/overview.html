<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>12 riders which is the maximum we can transport in 2 Campers.
  </li>
  <li>3 groups of riders with 3 to 5 riders per group.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotations will be a) Ride b) Rest c) Support ... repeat.
  </li>
  <li>Begin Jog 01:00 Friday morning. Arrive Le 09:00 Monday morning which gives us 80 hours to cover the
    distance.
  </li>
  <li>1000 miles over 80 hours means a target average speed of 12mph. Its not flat with approximately 1000 feet of climbing per 20 miles.
  </li>
  <li>
    The shift duration needs discussion and agreement but expected to be between 1 hour and 4 hours. Maybe we have
    shorter shifts during the day to allow more socialising and longer shifts during the night to allow more sleep.
  </li>
  <li>Still a little worried about the wind so hedging in case we need to switch direction. Will discuss and decide in the week
    leading up to the event.
</ul>
