<h1>Sleep</h1>

A few people have remarked that lack of sleep is their biggest concern.

There are several ways in which we can ensure that we can all get enough sleep, depending on personal preference.
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        As can be seen in <a href="rota2.html">dynamic rota page </a>, if we average 14mph moving time across the 3
        groups and aim to leave at 01:00
        Friday and arrive 09:00 Monday, then we can take <b>9 hours in breaks</b>
    </li>
    <li>We need to decide whether to take 3 hours per night ( Fri, Sat, Sun ) or longer breaks towards the end of the
        ride when we are more tired ( say 4.5 hours Sat and Sun ).
    </li>
    <li>If we make slower progress then of course these breaks will reduce in time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shift length</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <a href="rota2.html">dynamic rota page </a> gives a good idea of how the roles will pan out, between riding,
        support roles and camper.
    </li>
    <li>The length of riding shift needs discussion and agreement. Somewhere between 2 and 4 hour shifts seems likely
    </li>
    <li>Possibly shorter shifts in the daytime and longer shifts in the night time to facilitate sleeping.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sleeper - See Sleeper page <a href="index.html?sleeper.html">Sleeper</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 riders in sleeper should get some sleep ( though supposed to be in seats whilst driving )
    </li>
    <li>
        The CamperHQ will serve food after shift change so the Sleeper can hang around for a while then head off.
    </li>
    <li>The Sleeper will likely need to drive for 1/3 of the shift since it will be 3 times quicker than the riders (
        say 15 and 45 mph )
    </li>
</ul>
