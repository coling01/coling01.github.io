<h1>Travel to Start and Finish</h1>

The majority of riders will be travelling from the North West.

We need to transport all riders, all bikes and possibly support staff to start and back from finish.
Seems likely that we will have
<ul>
    <li>Van - easily 6</li>
    <li>CamperHQ - 6 max</li>
    <li>Sleeper - 6 max</li>
</ul>
<h2>12 riders No support</h2>
We can easily fit into the 3 vehicles likely 4 in each.
<h2>12 riders + 2 support</h2>
We can easily fit into the 3 vehicles likely 4 in Van and 5 in each Camper.
<h2>Transporting bikes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each camper has a 4 bike rack</li>
    <li>The van has a roof rack, we can take trailer if required but would be better to not have trailer to worry about. Maybe a good towbar bike rack would be best</li>
    <li>Ensure we have plenty of bungees and that its easy to get bikes on and off during changeovers</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, its likely that Bri will get the train up and down</p>
