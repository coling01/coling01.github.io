</ul>


<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 riders. Still hoping for some support, maybe just for half the trip.
    </li>
    <li>3 groups of riders with 3 to 5 riders per group.
    </li>
    <li>
        Groups are referred to as riders ( active ), off-riders ( just come off shift this not back on bikes for 2 shifts ), next-riders ( next up )
    </li>
    <li>Begin LeJog 01:00 Friday morning. Arrive LeJog 09:00 Monday morning which gives us 80 hours to cover the
        distance.
    </li>
    <li>1000 miles over 80 hours means an average speed of 12mph. But likely we can go quicker and have some complete
        breaks.
        ( See speed section for breakdowns )
    </li>
    <li>
        The shift duration needs discussion and agreement but expected to be between 1 hour and 4 hours. Maybe we have shorter shifts during the day to allow more socialising and longer shifts during the night to allow more sleep.
    </li>
</ul>
