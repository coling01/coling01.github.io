<h1>Weather</h1>

We need to plan for poor weather. This may mean considering the following, nearer the time.

<ul>
    <li>More spare gear for riders and having gear handy in van</li>
    <li>Having some capability for drying riders clothers in camper</li>
    <li>Possible impact on rider navigation with wet devices / poor batteries</li>
    <li>Sun would be nice and good chance in April we would just need to ensure sun cream available in van and plenty of fluids</li>
</ul>
