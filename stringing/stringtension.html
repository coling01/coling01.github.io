<h1>String Thickness / Tensions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        Trade off increased power against reduced control.
    </li>
    <li>
        More power comes from thinner strings or lower tension.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conversely, more control comes from thicker strings or higher tension.
    </li>
    <li>
        String tension has the greatest effect on power, followed by string material and last the string thickness,
        which has negligable effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ultra thin strings ( 19 gauge ) are 1.05mm thick. Such as Ashaway PowerNick 19.
    </li>
    <li>
        Thin strings ( 18 gauge ) range from 1.06mm to 1.15mm.
    </li>
    <li>
        Thick strings ( 17 gauge ) range from 1.16mm to 1.25mm. Thicker strings also offer increased durability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heavy strings ( 16 gauge ) range from 1.26mm to 1.34mm. More suitable for tennis rackets.
    </li>
    Technifibre green multifilament comes in 3 gauges namely 1.1mm (18 gauge, the thinnest), 1.2mm (17 gauge, the
    middle) and 1.3mm (16 gauge, the thickest).
    <li>
        String tension ranges from 20 to 30 lbs, with the average tension being 27 lbs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using a thinner string may require a lower tension to produce the same feel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rackets with long strings in the throat may require a higher tension. Someone with tennis elbow may benefit from
        lower tension, maybe as low as 24 lbs. Also, as multifilament is softer than monofilament, anyone with elbow
        issues should always use multifilament.
    </li>
    <li>Modern strings are multi filament core construction, which means very thin fibres twisted together. Old or cheap
        strings may be monofilament which is heavier and with less elasticity
    </li>
    <li>
        Most cores are made of nylon, but some manufacturers offer different materials that exhibit other performance
        characteristics. For example, the Zyex® fiber core of Ashaway’s PowerNick(tm) string line is made from a polymer
        called polyetheretherketone (or PEEK, for short). PEEK is stiffer than nylon multifilaments, but generates much
        more power than nylon monofilaments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apparently theres a racket tune app that listens to the ping of a racket string for given string types and
        guesses the tension.
    </li>
    <li>Sometimes we may have less tension in the cross strings to give the same flexibilty as in the longer main string
        strings.
    </li>
    <li>
        The cross strings constantly rub against the main strings and usually cause the main string to rub down and
        fail.
    </li>
    <li>
        A racket loses roughly 10 percent of its tension within a day of been strung and elasticity will reduce further
        in its lifetime, especially if used frequently.
    </li>
