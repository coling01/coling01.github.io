<h1>Hygiene</h1>

<p>Hygiene is very much weather depedent. If wet then will likely crave hot showers</p>
<p> If dry or warm then will want a good washup, but this can largely be down outside with a bucket of hot water</p>

<h2>Planned Stops</h2>
<p>Matty is planning the route in great detail with designated stopping points. This will include points of interest
    such as
    campsites so we may be able to plan using campsites along the route for showers / toilets etc. Maybe we will contact
    some of the campsites to see if possible to use the facilities, since we are raising money for charity.</p>

<h2>Toilet</h2>
<p>We have 2 campers and thus 2 toilets. Would be best to use alternative toilets when easily possible to avoid capacity
    issues. But we have the campers so no reason not to use them.</p>
<p>Best not to pee in the toilets as we would soon fill the cassettes, better to find a bush somewhere</p>
<p>Matty route will have some places maybe half way where we will plan to empty the toilets.
</p>

<h2>Washing</h2>
<p>Both campers will provide hot water for a basic wash and will have a shower for occasional use. Maybe a queue if 4
    riders come off shift and all want to take a shower. But no real reason why not, we can empty the grey water
    anywhere and easily refill at a fuel station</p>

<h2>Campsites</h2>
<p>The campers have membership of caravan club so maybe we can use this in some way. We can check the route and identify
    possible places to stop off for showers and maybe parkup for a few hours. And refresh water supplies / empty
    tanks. The grey water can just be run off into public drains. The toilet cassettes will need emptying at a
    campsite</p>
