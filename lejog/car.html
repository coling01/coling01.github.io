<h1>Car</h1>

<div>
    The car be used to head up the road as quickly as possible to provide opportunities to sleep.
    It will jump ahead for 2 shifts to maximise the rest time.
    It will have a driver and passenger.
    Expect that the car will have popup tent(s) and airbeds, unless an estate or van can be found with a bed in the bed.
    Maybe we should hire a small van ?
