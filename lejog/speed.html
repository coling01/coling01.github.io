<h1>Speed</h1>

<h2>Distance / Speed</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        We would like our route to be 1000 miles. Original plan was to try to average 14mph across the 3 groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        But we dont particularly want to arrive at LE in the middle of the night so rather than target an average speed
        it makes more sense to target a sensible arrival time in LE.
    </li>
    <li>
        9am seems a sensible time to arrive, so I have put some average speeds into some tables below.
    </li>
    <li>
        With a target arrival time of 09:00 Monday we could either setoff later ( maybe not set off in the dark ) or
        have some breaks
        in the riding, such as longer handovers. Or rider slower.
    </li>
    <li>
        As can be seen below (Green highlighted), if we average 14mph moving time across the 3 groups and aim to leave
        at 01:00 Friday and arrive 09:00 Monday, then we can take 9 hours in breaks
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="rota-singlebreak.html">dynamic rota page </a> gives detailed analysis on distance / riding shifts for given
        group speeds and confirms the timings on this page
    </li>
</ul>
