<h1>Vehicles</h1>

There are lots of permutations around vehicles which are roughly
<ul>
    <li>We really want lowest number of vehicles since 8 people off the bikes donâ€™t want to all be driving. But we need
        to get 12 up and down. Though maybe use train for some riders. Bri will likely get train.
    </li>
    <li>All permutations have some kind of car of van supporting riders. This could be small 2 man van or larger van if
        we also need it for transport up and down.
    </li>
    <li>We definitely want at least 1 camper for HQ and food.</li>
    <li>
        We could have 2 campers to provide more sleep permutations.
    </li>
</ul>
