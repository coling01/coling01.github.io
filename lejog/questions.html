<h1>Questions</h1>

<p>Whilst compiling the information across these pages I have come to a better understanding of how the trip will work
    out.

<p>Of course there are lots of decisions to be made, some need making more urgently and these are listed below</p>
<h2>Next Urgent</h2>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Question</th>
        <th>Supporting Information</th>
        <th>Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Do we have a car as well as Camper and Van ?</td>
        <td>It may be a burden to have an extra vehicle, especially if no support staff. We could manage with a van and
            an 8 berth camper, with generally 6 on board the camper. Having an extra vehicle to get up the road could
            provide sleep opportunities but since we have a 9 hours break window, this may not be needed.
        </td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Do we take our 9 hours break across multiple nights or maybe hotel Saturday night ?</td>
        <td>Some may prefer a real bed and shower etc.</td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Do we need support staff ?</td>
        <td>Ideally but dont have anybody coming forward yet and maybe we can manage without ?</td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Can we keep the direction open ?</td>
        <td>Ideally but Bri needs to book travel. If we want to book Hotel Sat night then maybe. We may need to decide
            soon.
        </td>
        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How will we get bikes to and from start / end?</td>
        <td>Depends if 2 or 3 vehicles. Roof racks would be tricky. Big trailer would be ideal. Any ideas ?</td>
        <td>?</td>

<h2>Less Urgent</h2>

        <th>Decision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How long shall we ride for ?</td>
        <td>Expect multiple of 30 minutes between maybe 1 hour at start of ride increasing to 3 or 4 hours during the
            night. Although we can play this by ear a little, it is helpful to have an idea for planning.

        <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>What route to take ?</td>
        <td>I have put down an approximate route in these pages, it is only 960 miles currently. Goes through Preston,
            do we want to pass through Alderley Edge as well ?
        </td>
