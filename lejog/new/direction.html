<h1>Direction to JOGLE or LEJOG</h1>

<div>Our preference is too JOGLE unless the winds are unfavourable, such as greater than 10mph against</div>
<div>The week before in Cornwall the winds were 15 north west so favouring Jogle.</div>
<div>The table below updated Sat 8th i.e. 1 week before middle of ride so still a little early.</div>
<div>The good news is that the winds are currently forecast to be light with no sign of any stormy weather and high pressure 1020 over the UK</div>
