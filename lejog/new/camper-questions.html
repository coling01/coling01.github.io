<h1>Camper Questions</h1>

<p>After seeing the campers we decided to go for 2 Lugano.</p>
<p>The main reason for this are <p>
<ul>
    <li>The Marco Polo was high profile because of over cab bed, which we did not really need in the CamperHQ. Better to
        have 2 bunk beds more comfortable for 2 blokes
    </li>
    <li>The Lugano has dedicate bunk beds at the bank thus more convenient for a quick nap.</li>
    <li>Getting both campers the same means less handover instructions, saving time for the named drivers when we
        pickup.
    </li>
    <li>The lower profile of the Lugano will be easier drive and less fuel</li>
</ul>
