<h1>Nutrition / Fuelling the Body</h1>

<p>We all need to ensure that we eat and drink sufficiently to avoid running low on fuel. This page contains some
    numbers indicating what the typical burn rates are and offers some example foods that can be used to refuel.
</p>
<p>Although we are all different, there are some basic rules that apply generally to all of us. The basic rules are
<ul>
    <li>The faster we go the more watts are required to maintain a given speed, this goes up exponentially above 15mph
    </li>
    <li>Watts burned per hour equate approximately to 1 gram of carbs per hour</li>
    <li>1 gram of carbs equates approximately to 4 calories ( calories derived from carbs excluding calories from
        protein or fats of course). So the figures given by strava for calories burned should be roughly 4 times the
        watt hours
    </li>
    <li>The maximum absorption rate of carbs in the body is typically between 60 and 90g of carbs per hour. So eating
        400g of carbs may take 5 hours to be fully absorbed or maybe its not all absorbed
    </li>
    <li>
        Headwind or tailwind signficantly affects speed for a given power.
        Comparing a 5mph tailwind with to 5mph headwind at 20mph changes power required from 150 watts to 350 watts.
        Or more sensibly, outputting 150 watts in a 5mph tailwind gets you 20mph, in a 5mph headwind it gets you 14mph.
        The table below shows power required to ride at given speeds for a 5mph tailwind, 0mph, 5mph headwind.
    </li>
    <li>Going up hills complicates significantly and riders weight becomes a big factor. So lets assume the route is
        flat to keep things simple.
    </li>
    <li>The massive variations in power required with wind and elevation explain why it makes more sense to train with a
        target of watts rather target speeds.
    </li>
    <li>If we have a significant headwind then we will mix the groups up to put 1 or 2 stronger riders on the front of each group</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The logical conclusion from the above rules is that it makes sense to take on board a steady supply of carbs whilst
    riding and then top up with a good meal immediately after riding. And ensure that the intake exceeds burns rate over
    each 12 hour period</p>
<p>Here is a good page that contains a calculator where you can vary speed, wind, elevation / weight to get watts, or
    vice versa. <a href="http://www.bikecalculator.com/">Bike Calculator</a></p>
