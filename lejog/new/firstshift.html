<h1>Start from JOG - First Shift</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Most people want to ride the first and last few miles.</li>
  <li>Will need a driver for HQ and Sleeper to skip this. Colin and Matt dont mind, will be quiet so not worry about Van
    insurance we wont be breaking any laws just dont crash.
  </li>
  <li>Seems sensible for A team to do first stretch. Colin and Matt can drop riders at JOG then drive ahead 5 miles and
    pickup B and C riders. Colin jumps on with the A team.
  </li>
  <li>How long first shift ? 4 hours seems good rest when tired but seems shame to not ride for 8 hours. And 4 hours is a long ride</li>
  <li>Shift length TBD on the way up. Colin prefers 2 hours initially then increasing to 4 hours for Fri and Sat night</li>
  <li>Shift length must be agreed between all teams as hopefully all will do a similar duration</li>
  <li>B team will support in HQ following the A riders</li>
  <li>C team will drive straight to rendezvous and rest.</li>
</ul>
