<h1>Vehicles</h1>

There are lots of permutations around vehicles which are roughly
a) We really want lowest number of vehicles since 8 people off the bikes donâ€™t want to all be driving. But we need to get 12 up and down. Though maybe use train for some riders.
b) All permutations have some kind of car of van supporting riders. This could be small 2 man van or larger van if we also need it for transport up and down.
c) We definitely want at least 1 camper for HQ and food.
d) We could have 2 campers to provide more sleep permutations.
