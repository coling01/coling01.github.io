<h1>Rota</h1>

<div>This is the tricky thing to outline without information overload.</div>
<div>On this page will suggest the rota broken down by how long on each activiy</div>
<p>
    Assuming 12 riders in 3 shifts of 4. Any additional riders will be either up the road in the car ( sleep ) or in the camper ( social / support / sleep )
</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 riders on the road</li>
    <li>2 riders driving the support van</li>
    <li>2 riders in the car heading up the road</li>
    <li>4 riders in the camper</li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Riders on the road</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time on the bike</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We expect that riders will do approximately equal shifts in time, though it makes sense that we agree the distance each
        shift will ride, taking into account the length of shift. This allows an approximate meeting location to be set
        before car and camper head off up the road. Thus the distances for the groups will differ slightly since groups will do 1/3 by time not 1/3 by distance.
    </li>
    <li>Riders will spend approximately 1/3 of the time on the road. This equates to 8 hours per day</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Riders driving Van</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/6 of the time in the Van.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders in van thus 1/6 of the time in Van. This equates to 4 hours per day. Maybe 2 hours as driver and 2 hours as passenger
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Riders in Car</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/6 of the time in the Car.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders in Car thus 1/6 of the time in Car. This equates to 4 hours per day. Some time driving, some time parked up.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Riders in Camper</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time in the Camper.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 riders in Car thus 1/3 of the time in Camper. This equates to 8 hours per day. Some time eating, some driving, some time parked up.
    </li>
</ul>
