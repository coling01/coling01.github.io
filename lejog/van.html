<h1>Support Van</h1>

<h2>Role of the Support Van</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The support van will provide close support to the riders to allow the campers to head up the road.</li>
    <li>
        The Van is Matty's subaru, a 7 seater with roof rack and 4 bike rack.
    </li>
    <li>
        The van will be driven by 1 rider whose role is "Van Driver". It is hoped that another rider ( who is off duty )
        will also accompany
        the Van driver for moral support. If the Van driver is tired, they may swap.
    </li>
    <li>
        The van will have a dedicated mobile phone so that all riders know who to ring with any problems.
    </li>
</ul>
Expect that the van will do something along the lines of
<ul>
    <li>After changing shift the riders coming off will eat parked up with the camper for 20-30 mins. This will mean the
        riders have got up the road by 6-8 miles
    </li>
    <li>The van will then chase the riders, slow and check they are ok as it passes for a few minutes</li>
    <li>Dish out any drinks, snacks, swap clothing that may be required</li>
    <li>Push on up the road for another few miles then park and wait for the riders to pass</li>
    <li>Again, support the riders with any requirements as the riders pass the van</li>
    <li>Allow the riders to get a few miles up the road, then drive to pass them and leap frog them again</li>
    <li>Any issues with the riders they will call the van and request attendance</li>
    <li>The van will carry tools and spares as deemed necessary</li>
    <li>Riders will carry their own spare tubes but may called the van for additional assistance, especially if puncture
        in the dark
    </li>
    <li>The van will be in contact with the CamperHQ and know where the changeover point is. As the riders get close to
        the rendezvous, the
        van will liase with the riders and lead them to the meetup with the camper where riders will change over
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
    Exact proximity of the van tbc. Some riders may prefer up close support whilst others prefers hands off but
    available when needed. It would be useful for the Van to push ahead of the riders and this identify any tricky
    navigation / hidden turnings.
