<h1>Route</h1>

<div>
    We would ideally like to keep the route open but as some may need to book trains this might not be possible.
    Will check recent weather for April before committing.
    South to North seems to be the general route because the winds tend to be westerly ( i.e. Off the Atlantic ).
    As a starter, I found a route at <a href="http://www.rideacrossbritain.com/home/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-route/">DeLoitte LeJog</a>
    For a South to North routing the route is approximately ( with miles and feet climbed )
    <ul>
        <li>LE</li>
        <li>Okehampton 107 / 7000</li>
        <li>Bath 110 / 6000</li>
        <li>Ludlow 100 / 4700</li>
        <li>Through or close to Alderley Edge?</li>
        <li>Haydock 105 / 2300</li>
        <li>Through or close to Preston?</li>
        <li>Penrith 105 / 4200</li>
        <li>Hamilton 100 / 2800</li>
        <li>Fort William 126 / 6000</li>
        <li>Kyle of Sutherland 110 /4900</li>
        <li>JOG 105 / 4100</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Total distance this route ( excluding any deviation for Alderly or Preston ) is 960 miles / 49,000 feet.
        It aint flat ! Maybe we need to reduce the average speeds to allow for some climbing ! What goes up must come down :)
