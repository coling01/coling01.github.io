<h1>Sleep</h1>

A few people have remarked that lack of sleep is their biggest concern.

There are several ways in which we can ensure that we can all get enough sleep, depending on personal preference.
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Leaving 01:00 Friday and aim to arrive 09:00 Monday gives us 80 hours</li>
    <li>1000 miles at 15/13/11 average 13 mph is 77 hours allows 3 hours complete break</li>
    <li>If we are fortunate to have a tail wind 16/14/12 average 14mph is 72 hours allows 8 hours complete break</li>
    <li>If we make slower progress then of course no break and may arrive later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shift length</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The medium speed <a href="rota-mediumnobreak.html">dynamic rota page </a> gives a good idea of how the roles
        will pan out, between riding,
        support roles and camper.
    </li>
    <li>The length of riding shift needs discussion and agreement. Somewhere between 2 and 4 hour shifts seems likely
    </li>
    <li>Possibly shorter shifts in the daytime and longer shifts in the night time to facilitate sleeping.</li>
    <li>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time riding, 1/3 of the time off duty and 1/3 of the time supporting current
        riders
    </li>
    <li>Riding - No sleep !</li>
    <li>Off Duty - Will likely eat for 15-20 mins, drive to next meet up takes 1/3 of the shift and then rest for remainder of shift. Will
        need to be up and ready for arrival of next riders say 10mins prep.
    </li>
    <li>Support - Depending on role may be able to snatch some sleep if really tired</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sleeper - See Sleeper page <a href="index.html?sleeper.html">Sleeper</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 riders in sleeper should get some sleep ( though supposed to be in seats whilst driving )
    </li>
    <li>
        The CamperHQ will serve food after shift change so the Sleeper can hang around for a while then head off.
    </li>
    <li>The Sleeper will likely need to drive for 1/3 of the shift since it will be 3 times quicker than the riders (
        say 15 and 45 mph )
    </li>
</ul>
