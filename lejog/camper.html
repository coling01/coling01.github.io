<h1>Camper</h1>

<h2>Role of the camper</h2>
<div>
    The camper is HQ and provides logistics, food, hygiene and maybe some sleep.
    <ul>
        <li>
            The camper will have a dedicated mobile phone so that the van or car can contact if required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook food ( see food page ) for riders coming off shift ( assuming shift of 2 hours+ )
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve food for off-riders who have come off shift and socialise ( 20-30 mins )
        </li>
        <li>
            Toilet and wash facilities. Quick showers at a push.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drive up the road after feeding off-riders
        </li>
        <li>
            Liase with car and van to know where to meet up for rider changeover.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hopefully laptop with maps and navigation to pinpoint car, van and possibly riders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Charging points for lights, phones, garmins
        </li>
        <li>
            Drying facility if wet weather ( somehow )
        </li>
        <li>
            Some beds for those who happy to sleep on move ( 1/3 of the time ) or parked ( 1/3 of the time )
        </li>
        <li>Transport for all 8 none riders bikes. No spare bike needed, all riders will buddy with a rider of similar
            size in another team to share bike in the event of bike problems. Need easy segregation of bikes to allow east identification.
            Maybe 4 on roof and 4 on rack / trailer. Or bikes labelled up with colour coded labels.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Role of support on board camper</h2>
In order of priority if we dont have much support ( which is highly likely and would mean more tasks falling to riders in camper ! )
<ul>
    <li>Delegate all activities below to a next-rider coming on shift if required</li>
    <li>Liase with next-riders coming on shift to agree distance to be covered ( related to shift length of course which is
        agreed with all riders the forthcoming shift lengths)
    </li>
    <li>Give written instructions to riders coming off shift as the approximate location of the changeover</li>
    <li>Track car and lead camper to car and van leading rider meetup for rider changeover</li>
    <li>Delegate these roles to rider from each team when necessary</li>
    <li>Help cook and serve food to riders coming off shift</li>
    <li>Ensure all vehicles know when to refuel and instruct drivers accordingly</li>
    <li>Be familiar with route for navigation assistance if required by car or van</li>
    <li>Assist riders coming off to get lights on charge</li>
    <li>Setup food area outside van if weather OK else eating area inside van if not</li>
    <li>Clear up after eating</li>
    <li>Help offload new riders bikes at meeting point before incoming riders arrive</li>
    <li>Help load up old riders bikes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role of the riders on board camper</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Help support / pickup any roles not covered by support or delegated by support</li>
    <li>Drive the camper ( likely required ) 1/3 of the time</li>
</ul>
