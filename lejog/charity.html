<h1>Proposed Charity</h1>

<h2>North West Cerebral Palsy Luke and Thomas</h2>

<p>Suggest we try and raise 5k which is about 400 each.</p>


<p>
    Thomas Hudson, five, and Luke Carter, eight, both have cerebral palsy after being born prematurely but have been
    offered a once-in-a lifetime chance to improve their conditions.
</p>
<p>
    The boys, who live only a mile apart in Cabus, north of Garstang, met by chance when attending appointments at Alder
    Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool and after both boys were approved for SDR surgery, the families joined forces.
    Thomas’ mum Jo Hudson said: “We know this is not a miracle cure. But it would be life-changing for Thomas and Luke
    as well as making our lives so much easier. “It can only help we’re in this together and we’ll do everything to
    raise the money.”
</p>
<p>
    The Hudson and Carter families have just nine months to raise the £50,000 which could see their
    lives change forever.
</p>
<p>
    Cerebral Palsy is a neurological
    condition which affects movement and co-ordination but Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery would improve Thomas
    and
    Luke’s lives. Not to mention their families, who must care for the two boys 24 hours a day because of the muscle
    stiffness the two boys suffer from.
</p>
<p>
    The NHS will carry out the operation, but not pay for it, so £50,000 must now be
    raised to pay for not only the two lots of surgery but the months of physio which follow.
