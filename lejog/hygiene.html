<h1>Hygiene</h1>

<h2>Toilet</h2>
<p>The camper will provide emergency toilet if desperate but would struggle to cope with 12 people</p>
<p>We will need to stop occasionally near toilet facilities which will need planing. Maybe stopping at a pub or services
    when near motorway services. This could allow use of shower facilities as well.
</p>

<h2>Washing</h2>
<p>The camper will provide hot water for a basic wash and will have a shower for emergency use if anybody desperate.</p>

<h2>Hotel Option</h2>
<p>Since we have 9 hours break, we could decide to take this in one go say Saturday night and stay at a Hotel. This would help greatly with hygience needs</p>
