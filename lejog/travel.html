<h1>Travel to Start and Finish</h1>

The majority of riders will be travelling from the North West.

We need to transport all riders, all bikes and possibly support staff to start and back from finish.

To give us maximum flexibility for transporting riders en route I think we need a large camper, at least 6 max.
This would also mean transport at each would be achievable as follows.

<h2>12 riders No support</h2>
With just 12 riders we would easily fit into the 3 vehicles.

<h2>12 riders + 2 support</h2>
a) 6 in camper 4 in car and 4 in van.

<h2>12 riders - transporting bikes</h2>
This could be a challenge I dont see any easy options here yet ....
a) Maybe a big bike trailer if could find one to hire.
b) Maybe Matties trailer 8 bikes and 4 bikes on roof / in van
