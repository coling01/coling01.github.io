<h1>Transition between Riders</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    The transition point is agreed before riders setoff and is pretty much fixed since the resting team will head
    straight there.
  </li>
  <li>In the event of the riders getting tired / struggling then the support team can take over early, the riders
    finishing early can take over support until the transition point. So if the C team get tired, the A team will be
    supporting and can switch shift early
  </li>
