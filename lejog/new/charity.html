<h2>North West Cerebral Palsy Luke</h2>
<a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/JOGLA4Luke">Just Giving Page</a>
<p>Suggest we try and raise 3k.</p>

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Luke Carter was born 12 weeks early and diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy.  He cannot stand or walk independently and relies on a wheelchair or walking frame to get around.

Despite this Luke is a happy and outgoing little boy who loves to sport and is a massive Manchester United and Preston North End fan.

Luke has been approved for an operation at Alder Hey Hospital which will improve his mobility and quality of life but as this is not funded by the NHS is seeking to raise £25,000 to make his hope a reality.
