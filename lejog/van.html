<h1>Support Van</h1>

<b>Whilst riding we will have 4 riders on the road, 4 riders up the road in Sleeper leaving 4 riders in support roles.
  Rather than split the 4 support team with 2 in HQ and 2 in Van we have decided to just take 2 campers.
  The role previously filled by the support Van will now be filled by the CamperHQ.
