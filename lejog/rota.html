<h1>Rota</h1>

<div>This is the tricky thing to outline without information overload.</div>
<div>On this page will suggest the rota broken down by how long on each activiy</div>
<p>
    Assuming 12 riders in 3 shifts of 4. Any additional riders will be either up the road in the sleeper or in the camperhq ( social / support / sleep )
</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 riders on the road</li>
    <li>2 riders driving the support van</li>
    <li>2 riders in the sleeper heading up the road</li>
    <li>4 riders in the camperhq</li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Riders on the road</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time on the bike</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We expect that riders will do approximately equal shifts in time, though it makes sense that we agree the distance each
        shift will ride, taking into account the length of shift. This allows an approximate meeting location to be set
        before sleeper and camperhq head off up the road. Thus the distances for the groups will differ slightly since groups will do 1/3 by time not 1/3 by distance.
    </li>
    <li>Riders will spend approximately 1/3 of the time on the road. This equates to 8 hours per day</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Riders driving Van</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/6 of the time in the Van.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders in van thus 1/6 of the time in Van. This equates to 4 hours per day. Maybe 2 hours as driver and 2 hours as passenger
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Riders in Sleeper</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/6 of the time in the Sleeper.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 riders in Sleeper thus 1/6 of the time in Sleeper. This equates to 4 hours per day. Some time driving, some time parked up.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Riders in CamperHQ</h2>
<p>Each rider will spend 1/3 of the time in the CamperHQ.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 riders in CamperHQ thus 1/3 of the time in CamperHQ. This equates to 8 hours per day. Some time eating, some driving, some time parked up.
    </li>
</ul>
